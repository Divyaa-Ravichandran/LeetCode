Intuition
The problem aims to find the level in a binary tree that has the maximum sum of node values. By traversing the tree in a breadth-first manner, we can calculate the sum of node values at each level and keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

Approach
Initialize a queue with the root node and set the maximum level and maximum sum to 1 and negative infinity, respectively.
Perform a breadth-first traversal of the binary tree using the queue.
At each level, calculate the sum of node values and store it in a variable.
Update the maximum sum and maximum level if the current level's sum is greater than the previous maximum.
Enqueue the children of the current nodes to process the next level.
Repeat steps 3-5 until all levels have been processed.
Return the maximum level with the maximum sum.
Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)O
Space complexity: O(n)


# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxLevelSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        queue=[root]
        maxlevel=1
        maxsum=float('-inf')
        level=1


        while queue:
            # Initialize level sum and next level
            levelsum=0
            nextlevel=[]


            # Process nodes at the current level
            for node in queue:
                # Update the level sum with the value of the current node
                levelsum+=node.val

                # Add the left and right child of the current node to the next level
                if node.left:
                    nextlevel.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    nextlevel.append(node.right)

            # Update the maximum sum and level if the current level sum is greater
            if levelsum > maxsum:
                maxsum=levelsum
                maxlevel=level

# Move to the next level
            queue=nextlevel
            level+=1

# Return the maximum level with the maximum sum
        return maxlevel
